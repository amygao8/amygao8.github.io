<p>Theranos' star was shining bright going into 2015.
</p>
<br>
<p>The blood-testing startup had racked up a $9 billion valuation with its big vision to test for a number of conditions using a small sample of blood, and its CEO Elizabeth Holmes was featured on the covers of business magazines and lists of top executives. But then questions started being raised about how the company's technology worked. 
</p>
<br>

<p>As Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou details in his book, "Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup," the events leading up to the downfall of the company started unfolding years earlier. The book gives a behind the scenes look into the events that propelled Theranos into chaos.

      <p>Nineteen-year-old Stanford chemical and electrical engineering drop-out Elizabeth Holmes founded Theranos with the aim of revolutionizing blood testing. Using a "nanotainer" (a small device designed to draw, retain, and analyze a droplet of blood from a patient’s fingertip) and its proprietary "Edison" testing technology, Theranos claimed the device could run a multitude of tests on a patient’s physiology within minutes and at a fraction of the cost of current technology.</p>

      <p>Despite her company's hefty valuation, Holmes remained tight-lipped on how exactly Theranos’s technology worked. It turned out that the technology had never been submitted for peer review in medical journals. A New Yorker profile termed her explanations "comically vague," citing as one example Holmes's statement that "a chemistry is performed so that a chemical reaction occurs and generates a signal from the chemical interaction with the sample, which is translated into a result, which is then reviewed by certified laboratory personnel."</p>

      <p>The Wall Street Journal ran a scathing article criticizing Theranos. Based on interviews with ex-employees, the newspaper alleged rampant management incompetence and claimed that Theranos had grossly exaggerated the capabilities of its proprietary technology. One former senior employee stated that only a small fraction of all the tests were conducted on the "Edison machines," and the majority of tests were handled on competitors’ equipment despite Theranos’s claims to the contrary. If true, this would have been a violation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules.</p>

      <p>Holmes appeared on "Mad Money" and other media outlets to do damage control. She was “shocked” by the Wall Street Journal article and claimed that Theranos supplied over 1,000 pages of documentation to refute the allegations. The Wall Street Journal stood by its reporting.</p>

      <p>The FDA released two partially-redacted Form 483 reports from an ongoing investigation into Theranos. The reports were less than favorable and claimed that Theranos had "uncleared medical device(s)," poor records, was mishandling complaints, and had failed to conduct audits and produce supplier qualifications. In regard to an unspecified medical device, an investigator noted "the design was not validated under actual or simulated use conditions." Further, Theranos failed to “ensure the device conforms to defined user needs and intended uses.”</p>

      <p>The SEC charges Theranos, its founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes, and its former President Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani with massive fraud. The complaint alleged that the company raised more than $700 million by deceiving investors for years about the company's performance. Both Theranos and Holmes agreed to settle the fraud charges pending court approval. Holmes lost control of the company, returned millions of shares, and was barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years.</p>

      <p>A federal grand jury indicted both Holmes and Balwani on nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The press release from the U.S. Attorney's Office stated that in order to promote Theranos, both Holmes and Balwani "engaged in a multi-million dollar scheme to defraud investors and a separate scheme to defraud doctors and patients." 

        <br>
      Holmes had stepped down as Theranos CEO earlier in the day although she continues to be the chair of the company's board.</p>
